The First Innings Score Prediction project using Linear Regression is a statistical model designed to predict the expected score of a cricket team in their first innings of a match. The model utilizes a range of factors such as team composition, pitch conditions, weather conditions, and past performance to generate accurate predictions. With the help of machine learning techniques, the model learns from historical data and is capable of making predictions for future matches. The project is expected to provide valuable insights for cricket analysts, bookmakers, and fans who are interested in understanding the dynamics of the game.
